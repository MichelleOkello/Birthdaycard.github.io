      <h1>Joyeaux Anniversaire Charlotte!</h1>
      <p>Words are not enough to say how much you mean to me, long distance made sure we couldnt celebrate in person. Our friendship has now lasted more than 10 years and
      youve always been here to support me. Your prescence brings laughter and joy in my life and i feel incredibly lucky to have known you.
      honestly love how we match each other level of ambition and growth and im so excited for the incredible memories that awaits us. <br>
      On this special day i hope that you experience joy and love from everyone around you, including me. You deserve nothing but success and
      so much happiness and i pray this new year brings you all of that. <br>
      Cheers to a new year. </p></p>
      <p>Love, Michelle</p>
